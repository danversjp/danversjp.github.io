      <description>I defended my PhD titled &amp;ldquo;Design and Security Analysis of Lattice-based Post-Quantum Encryption&amp;rdquo; on May 28th.
My PhD thesis can be found [here]. A recording of my defence can be found [here]. This presentation is aimed at a broad audience and should be followable without background knowledge.</description>

      <description>Engineering and science communications have always been passions of mine. However, I&amp;rsquo;m always looking forward to broaden my horizon with new and challenging projects. A non-exhaustive (and quite random) list of projects and experiences in which I took part can be found below.
  Exploitation of research: technology &amp;amp; knowledge transfer:
5 days training on research valorisation by KU Leuven Research &amp;amp; Development (LRD), including sessions on intellectual property law, industry collaboration and exploitation plans and with a hands-on project on validation of research results.</description>

      <description>Wetenschapsbattle / Battle of the Scientists:
Science communication challenge: present your research to children age 6-12. I was selected of one of the five finalists and presented my work to an audience of 3500 children. (in dutch) [link]
  Science figured out: How to keep a secret?:
3 minute video presentation on the need for post-quantum cryptography and side-channel attacks for a broad audience (in dutch) [link]</description>

      <description>Iâ€™m a post-doctoral researcher in the COSIC research group at KU Leuven, Belgium. I&amp;rsquo;m currently mostly involved in BELFORT, our hardware accelerator for Homomorphic Encryption BELFORT.
My research interests include implementation and acceleration of fully homomorphic encryption; and development, security and side-channel secure implementation of post-quantum encryption. I was involved in the development of the encryption algorithm Saber, which is one of the candidates for standardization in the NIST post-quantum standardization process.</description>
