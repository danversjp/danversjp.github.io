      <description>Engineering and science communications have always been passions of mine. However, I&amp;rsquo;m always looking forward to broaden my horizon with new and challenging projects. A non-exhaustive (and quite random) list of projects and experiences in which I took part can be found below.
  Exploitation of research: technology &amp;amp; knowledge transfer:
5 days training on research valorisation by KU Leuven Research &amp;amp; Development (LRD), including sessions on intellectual property law, industry collaboration and exploitation plans and with a hands-on project on validation of research results.</description>

      <description>Wetenschapsbattle / Battle of the Scientists:
Science communication challenge: present your research to children age 6-12. I was selected of one of the five finalists and presented my work to an audience of 3500 children. (in dutch) [link]
  Science figured out: How to keep a secret?:
3 minute video presentation on the need for post-quantum cryptography and side-channel attacks for a broad audience (in dutch) [link]</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD student in the COSIC research group at KU Leuven, Belgium under the supervision of Ingrid Verbauwhede and Frederik Vercauteren. I research the security and efficiency of post-quantum cryptography, with a focus on lattice-based cryptography. I&amp;rsquo;m involved in the development of the encryption algorithm Saber, which is one of the candidates for standardization in the NIST post-quantum standardization process.
 That was gobbledigook to me, now in human language?</description>
