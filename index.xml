      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD student in the COSIC research group at KU Leuven, Belgium under the supervision of Ingrid Verbauwhede and Frederik Vercauteren. I research the security and efficiency of post-quantum cryptography, with a focus on lattice-based cryptography.
 That was gobbledigook to me, now in human language?  Cryptography is the study of secure communication, for example encrypting messages into a secret code. It is essentially used on nearly every electronic device connected to the internet: computers, smartphones, car keys, medical databases, bank cards, .</description>
